# Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleansing, Data Preparation and Data Visualization

This is a list of few of my data analytics projects which contain Data Cleansing, Data Preparation and Data Visualization.

File Name and Description                                             | Link   
--------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------
<code>A_Prediction_Model_in_Python</code> This repository contains a Python project consisting in analyzing few data sets, fitting and evaluating different prediction models and making a prediction. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/A_Prediction_Model_in_Python/blob/master/README.md</sub>
<code>Time_Use_in_Finland</code> A Data Cleansing and Visualization Project in Python. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Time_Use_in_Finland/blob/master/README.md</sub>
<code>A_Data_Analysis_Project_in_R.html</code> This study uses publicly available data to create a research question for which first some exploratory data analysis is done and then inferential statistics is performed to verify if the possible correlations that have been found are statistically relevant. The file has been produced in R by using RStudio. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/R/blob/master/A_Data_Analysis_Project_in_R.html</sub>
<code>Getting and Cleaning Data Project</code> This is a link to a repository containing a script to upload, clean and prepare some data sets. A Code Book is also contained. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/GettingAndCleaningData</sub>
<code>A_Plotting_Project_in_Python_using_Matplotlib.html</code> This project consists in data manipulation and plotting composite graphs by using matplotlib. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/A_Plotting_Project_in_Python_using_Matplotlib.html</sub>
<code>Creating_a_Customized_Visualization.html</code> This project is a Python implementation of an idea discussed in a paper from Ferreira, Fisher and Konig, which allows visualizing a plot that helps in making judgements about probabilistic data generated through samples. It produces an interactive plot. (In order to test the interactive feature, copy and paste the source code to your Jupyter Notebook environment.) | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Creating_a_Customized_Visualization.html</sub>
<code>Hypothesis_Test_with_Python_Pandas.html</code> This project consists in retrieving and manipulating data from different files and then performing a hypothesis test. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Hypothesis_Test_with_Python_Pandas.html</sub>
<code>Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.html</code> In this project, three files are loaded in Python as Pandas dataframes. Those dataframes are cleansed and then merged into a single data set. The dataset is further manipulated to find average values, max values, etc ... New columns are added to calculate new variables. Then data from a Python dictionary is added to do further data manipulation and new dataframes are created. The work has been done by using Jupyter Notebook. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.html</sub>
