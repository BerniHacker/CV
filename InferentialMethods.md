<code>A_Data_Analysis_Project_in_R.html</code> This study uses publicly available data to create a research question for which first some exploratory data analysis is done and then inferential statistics is performed to verify if the possible correlations that have been found are statistically relevant. The file has been produced in R by using RStudio. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/R/blob/master/A_Data_Analysis_Project_in_R.html</sub>
