<code>Fitting_a_Multiple_Linear_Regression_Model.html</code> In this document a data set is analyzed, a relevant research question is created and some exploratory data analysis is performed. Then a linear regression model is developed and this model is used to do some prediction. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/R/blob/master/Fitting_a_Multiple_Linear_Regression_Model.html</sub>
