# Python Programming

This is a list of few of my data analytics projects which contain programming in Python.

File Name and Description                                             | File Link   
--------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------
<code>Scraping_Web_Pages.py</code> The program asks the user to insert a URL and then reads the HTML, searches for a link that is in a user-provided position respect to the top of the page and follows that link. The process is repeated a user-defined number of times and returns the visible text corresponding to the last found link. Validation of user input is performed. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Scraping_Web_Pages.py</sub>
<code>Using_a_Web_Service.html</code> This program prompts for a location, contacts a web service, retrieves JSON data corresponding to the web service and the user-defined location and finds some data. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Using_a_Web_Service.html</sub>
<code>Extracting_JSON_Data.html</code> This program prompts for a URL, reads the JSON data from that URL, extracts some data and does some calculation. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Extracting_JSON_Data.html</sub>
<code>Extracting_XML_Data.py</code> This program prompts for a URL, reads the XML data from that URL, extracts some data and does some calculation. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Extracting_XML_Data.py</sub>
