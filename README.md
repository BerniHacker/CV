- DiChiaraBernardoCV09042018.pdf is the short version of my CV in pdf format
- Self-CreatedCoursePlan.pdf is my self-created personalized study plan
- A_Prediction_Model_Project_in_R.html is the artifact "A Prediction Model in R" which is part of my portfolio. The project consists in building and comparing different prediction models.

- Fitting_a_Multiple_Linear_Regression_Model.html is the artifact "Fitting a Multiple Linear Regression Model" which is part of my portfolio. In this document a data set is analyzed, a relevant research question is created and some exploratory data analysis is performed. Then a linear regression model is developed and this model is used to do some prediction.

is the artifact "A Data Analysis Project in R" which is part of my portfolio. This study uses publicly available data to create a research question for which first some exploratory data analysis is done and then inferential statistics is performed to verify if the possible correlations that have been found are statistically relevant. The file has been produced by using RStudio.
