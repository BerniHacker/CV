> NEW! (06.11.2018): <code>Time_Use_in_Finland</code> A Data Cleansing and Visualization Project in Python. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Time_Use_in_Finland/blob/master/README.md</sub>

> NEW! (27.10.2018): <code>Creating_a_Customized_Visualization.html</code>
This project is a Python implementation of an idea discussed in a paper from Ferreira, Fisher and Konig, which allows visualizing a plot that helps in making judgements about probabilistic data generated through samples. It produces an interactive plot. (In order to test the interactive feature, copy and paste the source code to your Jupyter Notebook environment.)

<code>A_Prediction_Model_Project_in_R.html</code> This project consists in building and comparing different prediction models by using R. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/CV/blob/master/A_Prediction_Model_Project_in_R.html</sub>
<code>Fitting_a_Multiple_Linear_Regression_Model.html</code> In this document a data set is analyzed, a relevant research question is created and some exploratory data analysis is performed. Then a linear regression model is developed and this model is used to do some prediction. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/CV/blob/master/Fitting_a_Multiple_Linear_Regression_Model.html</sub>
<code>A_Data_Analysis_Project_in_R.html</code> This study uses publicly available data to create a research question for which first some exploratory data analysis is done and then inferential statistics is performed to verify if the possible correlations that have been found are statistically relevant. The file has been produced in R by using RStudio. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/CV/blob/master/A_Data_Analysis_Project_in_R.html</sub>
<code>A_Programming_Project_in_R.html</code> This project consists in creating a function and gives an example of my programming skills in R. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/CV/blob/master/A_Programming_Project_in_R.html</sub>
