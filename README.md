# CV

This repository contains my CV and links to my portfolio of data analytics projects. Those links are grouped under the following topics:

- Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleansing, Data Preparation and Data Visualization
- Statistics: Inferential Methods
- Prediction Models and Machine Learning
- Databases (SQL, Hadoop)
- Python Programming
- R Programming

Note that a single project might be listed under more than one topic (for example, a project where inferential methods are used contains also data cleansing and data visualization).
