# CV

This repository contains my CV and links to my portfolio of data analytics projects. Those links are grouped under the following topics:

- Data Pipelining
- Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleansing, Data Preparation and Data Visualization
- Statistics: Inferential Methods
- Prediction Models and Machine Learning
- Databases (SQL, Hadoop)
- Python Programming
- R Programming
- Shell scripts

Note that a single project might be listed under more than one topic (for example, a project where inferential methods are used contains also data cleansing and data visualization).

> NEW! (10.10.2019): <code>SQL_to_CSV.py</code> This script queries the full content of a defined table of a defined MySQL database (with defined credentials) and stores the result of the query temporarily into a pandas dataframe. The content of the dataframe is then dumped into a file with a defined name. The script allows handling "large data". Both the SQL query and the dump into the CSV file are performed in chunks according to pre-defined paramater values. <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/SQL_to_CSV.py</sub>

> NEW! (09.10.2019): <code>dump_SQL_table.sh</code> This script is a template for dumping a table from one MySQL database to another MySQL database. The copy is done in chunks and therefore the script can be used also for huge tables. <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Linux/blob/master/dump_SQL_table.sh </sub>
