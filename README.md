# CV

This repository contains my CV and links to my portfolio of data analytics projects. Those links are grouped under the following topics:

- Data Cleansing, Data Preparation and Data Visualization
- Statistics: Inferential Methods
- Prediction Models and Machine Learning
- Databases (SQL, Hadoop)
- R Programming
- Python Programming

Note that a single project might be listed under more than one topic (for example, a project where inferential methods are used contains also data cleansing and data visualization).

> NEW! (06.11.2018): <code>Time_Use_in_Finland</code> A Data Cleansing and Visualization Project in Python. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Time_Use_in_Finland/blob/master/README.md</sub>

> NEW! (27.10.2018): <code>Creating_a_Customized_Visualization.html</code>
This project is a Python implementation of an idea discussed in a paper from Ferreira, Fisher and Konig, which allows visualizing a plot that helps in making judgements about probabilistic data generated through samples. It produces an interactive plot. (In order to test the interactive feature, copy and paste the source code to your Jupyter Notebook environment.)
